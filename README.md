## 🧠 What You’ll Find & Goals

This repository includes:

- Model training pipelines (e.g. data loading, augmentation, training loops)
- Experiments with different architectures (Inception, EfficientNet, DenseNet, VGG, Xception)
- Usage of pretrained weights and fine-tuning
- Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, etc.
- Comparative performance across models for disease classification tasks

The goal is to explore and benchmark various deep learning architectures on biological / plant disease datasets, share code and learnings, and provide reference notebooks for others.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/00Ali001/Deep-learning-projects.git
   cd Deep-learning-projects
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**

   Use Python (ideally >= 3.7) with packages such as:
   ```
   torch
   torchvision
   numpy
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   scikit-learn
   tqdm
   timm  # if using models not in torchvision
   ```

   You can use a `requirements.txt` (you may add one) or Conda environment.

3. **Prepare your dataset**

   Many notebooks assume your dataset is in a folder structure like:

   ```
   dataset_root/
     ├ class1/
     │    img1.jpg
     │    img2.jpg
     ├ class2/
     │    ...
     └ class3/
   ```

   Some notebooks may include augmentation steps (unzip, preprocessing). Adjust the `data_dir` paths accordingly.

4. **Run notebooks**

   Open `.ipynb` files in Jupyter / Colab / VSCode and run cells. You can change hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, epochs, model architecture, etc.

5. **Evaluate & compare**

   Use the generated accuracy / loss curves, classification reports, confusion matrices to judge which models perform best for your task.

## ✅ Tips & Notes

- Always use **validation** and **test** splits to avoid overfitting.
- Use **data augmentation** (flip, rotate, color jitter) for better generalization.
- For models not in `torchvision` (like Inception-v4), you may need external libraries like `timm`.
- Save your best model weights (e.g. via `torch.save`) so you don’t lose progress.
- Comment and document your experiments so they remain reproducible.
